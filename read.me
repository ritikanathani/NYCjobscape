Project Summary

For this project, all aspects were addressed, including the cleanup of duplicates in the dataset, narrowing down of the dataset, statistical analysis, data visualization, result evaluation, and conclusion formulation. The entire project was conducted independently.

The initial focus of the project was on the significant increase in New York home prices. While considering how to analyze New York's home prices, the project's scope shifted towards understanding how much New Yorkers need to earn annually to afford the high housing costs. To achieve this, NYC jobs datasets were obtained from NYC OpenData, with an emphasis placed on uncovering the relationships within the dataset, particularly focusing on differences in annual salaries based on job categories and career levels.

The dataset is intended for use by students and professionals interested in working in New York City to stay updated on job market trends. It serves as a valuable resource for making informed career decisions by considering the risks and rewards associated with different fields, including competition, job availability, and growth potential.

One of the key findings was the presence of an abundance of job openings, especially in the public safety, social services, and building operations categories. High demand was observed for both entry-level and experienced positions, and a preference for internal hires was noted within many companies. Additionally, the median salary in NYC was approximately $80,000 across all categories, with the technology, data, and innovation sector standing out, featuring a median salary range of $100,000 to $110,000. Furthermore, various job categories indicated the potential for higher earnings, especially at the executive level. Insights into identifying agencies with jobs in the desired salary range were provided through visualizations of agency data categorized by career level and salary. Hence, consideration should be given not only to job categories but also to the level of positions and agencies.

Challenges were encountered during the analysis. Some occupations had minimum salaries starting at '0', impacting the calculation of median salaries. The dataset also offered options for hourly, daily, and annual salaries, which were standardized to full-time positions by multiplying hourly pay by 35 (hours per week) and 48 (weeks per year) to obtain uniform annual salaries. Another challenge was the presence of numerous job categories, which limited traceability. The metadata was revisited, and similar jobs were grouped into broader categories using a decision structure, resulting in a reduction of over 3000 job openings to 12 compartments.

This data analysis provides valuable insights for New Yorkers to estimate their salary expectations based on their chosen field and level. It is believed that this study can be expanded by integrating a dataset on NYC's cost of living to analyze whether the job market is keeping up with rising living costs. Additionally, meaningful results could be obtained by incorporating salaries and cost of living indices from other cities or by comparing salaries between remote and in-person work. Furthermore, with further development, the code used can be transformed into a job search engine for those seeking employment in the city.
